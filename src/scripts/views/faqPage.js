					<h2>What the heck does Hashiru mean, anyway?</h2>
					<h4>Hashiru is the Japanese word for "run"</h4>
					<h2>So, why should I Hashiru?</h2>
					<h4>Running has many benefits for the mind and body.</h4>
					<h2>How do I use your site?</h2>
					<h4>It's easy! Just make an account. After you run, come back here and log your miles.</h4>
					<h2>Why?</h2>
					<h4>So you can earn online badges that aren't worth anything, of course.</h4>
					<h2>What's the difference between a quest and a boss battle?</h2>
					<h4>Quest badges are earned per run. Boss badges are earned as miles accumulate over time.</h4>
