					<h4>What the heck does Hashiru mean, anyway?</h4>
					<h5>Hashiru is the Japanese word for "run"</h5>
					<h4>So, why should I Hashiru?</h4>
					<h5>Running has many benefits for the mind and body.</h5>
					<h4>How do I use your site?</h4>
					<h5>It's easy! Just make an account. After you run, come back here and log your miles.</h5>
					<h4>Why?</h4>
					<h5>So you can earn online badges that aren't worth anything, of course.</h5>
					<h4>What's the difference between a quest and a boss battle?</h4>
					<h5>Quest badges are earned per run. Boss badges are earned as miles accumulate over time.</h5>
